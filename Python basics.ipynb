What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","Answer: Python is an easy-to-learn programming language used for many tasks like web development, data analysis, and automation. It is popular because it's simple, flexible, and has a large supportive community with lots of helpful tools.\n","\n","#Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","Answer:  An interpreter in Python is a tool that reads and runs your Python code directly, one line at a time. It translates your code into actions that the computer can understand and perform right away. This makes it easier to see results quickly.\n","\n","#Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","Answer: Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that have a specific meaning and are reserved by the language. These words cannot be used as names for variables, functions, or other identifiers. Examples include words like if, else, while, for, and def. They are used to define the structure and behavior of Python code.\n","\n","#Q4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","Answer: No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. They are reserved words with special meanings, like if, else, and for, and using them as variable names would cause an error.\n","\n","#Q5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","Answer: Mutability in Python refers to whether an object can be changed after it is created.\n","\n","#Q6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","Answer: Lists are mutable because you can change, add, or remove items in them after they are created. Tuples are immutable because once they are created, their items cannot be changed or modified. This difference helps keep tuples safe from accidental changes, while lists allow more flexibility for modification\n","\n","#Q7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n","\n"," Answer: In Python:\n","\n","== checks if the values of two things are the same.\n","is checks if two things are actually the same object in memory.\n","So, == compares values, while is compares the objects themselves.\n","\n","#Q8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","Answer:- Logical operators in Python (and, or, not) are used to combine or reverse conditions in expressions.\n","\n","#Q9. What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","Answer: Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into another, like turning an integer into a string or a float into an integer. You can do this using functions like int(), str(), or float().\n","\n","#Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","\n","Answer: The difference between implicit and explicit type casting in Python is:\n","\n","Implicit type casting: Python automatically converts one data type to another (e.g., from integer to float) without you asking for it.\n","Explicit type casting: You manually convert one data type to another using functions like int(), str(), or float().\n","\n","#Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","\n","Answer: The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to make decisions in your code. They allow the program to run different actions based on whether a condition is true or false. The main conditional statements are if, elif, and else.\n","\n","#Q12. How does the elif statement work ?\n","\n","Answer: The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if.\" It is used after an if statement to check another condition if the first condition is false. If the if condition is false, Python checks the elif condition. If it's true, the code under elif runs. If none of the conditions are true, the else statement (if present) will run.\n","\n","#Q13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n","\n","Answer: a for loop is used when you know how many times you want to repeat, while a while loop is used when you want to repeat as long as a condition is true.\n","\n","#Q14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n","\n","Answer: A while loop is more suitable when you don't know how many times you need to repeat the action, but you want it to continue as long as a condition is true.\n","\n","Example: Checking a user’s input until they enter a valid number.\n","\n","user_input = \"\"\n","while not user_input.isdigit():\n","    user_input = input(\"Please enter a valid number: \")\n","print(f\"Valid number entered: {user_input}\")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xBQ7mtiU10nx"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Practical Question"],"metadata":{"id":"FFyVIk3-8gFe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["### Write a Python program to print \"Hello, World!\"\n","\n","print(\"Hello sir good morning!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FLIEbQ128rAD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742775787336,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":44,"user":{"displayName":"vishal sharma","userId":"12487652041025432006"}},"outputId":"f7b006d8-42c3-4c2e-e5fd-be2507539d8f"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello sir good morning!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["### Write a Python program that displays your name and age ?\n","\n","name = \"Vishal\"\n","age = 22\n","\n","print(\"Name:\", name)\n","print(\"Age:\", age)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"brW0NFA58z5U","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737581986971,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":741,"user":{"displayName":"vishal sharma","userId":"12487652041025432006"}},"outputId":"48073a97-e599-45a0-8117-bb3e68a88e68"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Name: Vishal\n","Age: 22\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["### Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using the keyword library\n","\n","import keyword\n","\n","# Print all the pre-defined keywords in Python\n","print(keyword.kwlist)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"q4HJ0f_v8z1S","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737582018080,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":414,"user":{"displayName":"vishal sharma","userId":"12487652041025432006"}},"outputId":"f66c1932-6c74-41f4-a324-177373748bcb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["### Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword\n","\n","import keyword\n","\n","# Get input from the user\n","word = input(\"if: \")\n","\n","# Check if the word is a Python keyword\n","if keyword.iskeyword(word):\n","    print(f\"'{word}' is a Python keyword.\")\n","else:\n","    print(f\"'{word}' is not a Python keyword.\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"HFL_yCk28zye","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737582080742,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4570,"user":{"displayName":"vishal sharma","userId":"12487652041025432006"}},"outputId":"711ee7c4-8aac-412e-80eb-af7748633e9d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["if: if\n","'if' is a Python keyword.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["### Create a list and tuple in Python, and demonstrate how attempting to change an element works differently for each\n","\n","\n","# Create a list and a tuple\n","my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)\n","\n","# Attempt to change an element in the list\n","my_list[2] = 99\n","print(\"Updated list:\", my_list)\n","\n","# Attempt to change an element in the tuple (this will raise an error)\n","try:\n","    my_tuple[2] = 99\n","except TypeError as e:\n","    print(\"Error when modifying tuple:\", e)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"JkLbaxui8zvm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1737582109959,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":397,"user":{"displayName":"vishal sharma","userId":"12487652041025432006"}},"outputId":"b4fabc27-c213-40d3-9e91-f7786c0f5103"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Updated list: [1, 2, 99, 4]\n","Error when modifying tuple: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["### Write a function to demonstrate the behavior of mutable and immutable arguments ?\n","\n","def modify_args(immutable_arg, mutable_arg):\n","    print(\"Before modification:\")\n","    print(\"Immutable argument:\", immutable_arg)\n","    print(\"Mutable argument:\", mutable_arg)\n","\n","    #
